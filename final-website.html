    <p1>Shading in Traditional Art:</p1>

    <p>When shading in traditional art, you first need to practice with the basics, like drawing a sphere. You first need to sketch a circle and determine where your source of light will be coming from.</p>

    <p>After finding your light souce, you want to shade in the opposite half of the circle where the light source cannot reach</p>

        <p>After you've made the form shadow and the shadow that's being cast, you then want to add the highlights to your sphere. Just take your pencil and lightly brush it on the paper between that empty space of the cirlce and the form shadow.</p>

        <p>If you want to shade while creating digital art, you would first have to decide on what to draw, but make sure you use different layers. One issue digital artists face while creating art is always accidentally drawing on the same layer as their
            outline or sketch layer.</p>
